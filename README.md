# PactSwiftServer

[![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg?style=flat)](LICENSE.md)

A wrapper around [`libpact_ffi.a`][libpact-ffi] binary and exposed as XCFramework to be primarily used by [`PactSwift`][pact-swift].

This XCFramework is an artefact generated by the [`release`][build-result] script in [`PactSwiftMockServer`][pact-swift-mock-server].

It is stored and shared here without the old git history that contains all the overblown versions of `libpact_ffi.a` which blew up the size of the repository.

> [!WARNING]
> With newer tags and releases the old ones _could_ get wiped without notice if this repository blows up too.
